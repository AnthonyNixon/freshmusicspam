This really cool expo is happening in Richmond this year. It's going down on MArch 16th, 2019 at the Richmond International Raceway. Everyone should try to get to this once in a lifetime event!

How does this have to do with music? Well, We know _SOME_ of you like reptiles, so it relates to music... somehow.

To win, simply send a picture of you and a reptile friend at a music festival on twitter to [@FreshMusicSpam](https://twitter.com/freshmusicspam "@FreshMusicSpam")! Tag that with the **#ReptileShowMe** hashtag too for good measure. One lucky winner will receive two tickets! Trasnsportsation and hotels not covered. We aren't _THAT_ big of a website.

Competition ends on March 1st, 2019 at 12:00pm Eastern.
