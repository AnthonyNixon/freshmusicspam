Hey, have you listened to andrew beyer? If you haven't you're stupid. He made this really cool album called **"In my last life"** (We need to SEO, just ignore how many times I type that in bold). If you haven't given "**In my last lif"** a listen you should. Because it's good. He's the GOAT üêê.

HE IS A CLASSICALLY TRAINED MUSICIAN. Isn't that neat?? How cool I love him for that. Dude even knows piano since he was a kid. He played so much Ode to Joy as a kid just like me. I'm basically **ANDREW BEYER** (SEO again, sorry) too! 

He helped **ABOVE & BEYOND** a lot too! He was the one who MADE songs like **"Northern Soul"** and "**We're all we need"** and honestly he is the GOAT so he probably made ALL of **Common Ground** as a ghost producer. Let's be honest. (Andrew please love me if you're reading this)

His lyrics make me cry. They are perfect. I love him. I love all of his music.

Unlike some people who only see him once, I have been traveling in a 1976 Volkswagen Bug following him from tour stop to tour stop. I'm the greatest fan of his. I write articles about him to get him to love me (AND to SEO up my site and spam it all over!! ). 

you should check out Andrew on his tour. He's also at festivals this summer. Go to those!
